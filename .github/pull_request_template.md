## Naming Conventions

Common types according to [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum) can be:

- **build**—changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).

- **chore**—other changes that don’t modify src or test files.

- **ci**—changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).

- **docs**—documentation only changes.

- **feat**—a new feature.

- **fix**—a bug fix.

- **perf**—a code change that improves performance.

- **refactor**—a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.

- **revert**—reverts a previous commit.

- **style**—changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).

- **test**—adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.

### Branches
